# Mr. X
This project is an App version of Ravensburger's Mr. X.

It was created in the course of my studies and is my first attempt of creating an App, creating a game and implementing a MVVM-Architecture.

## Rules
The rules are available online, but for the (or rather *the following*) english version a registration is necessary: 
- [Rules as PDF-Download on boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/49237/mister-x-english-rules)

German versions are a little easier to come by:
